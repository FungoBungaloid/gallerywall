## Configuration

You can customize various settings in `config.py`:

- Canvas dimensions
- Zoom limits
- Grid settings
- Default shadow parameters
- Color presets for mats and frames
- Supported image formats

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed: `python --version`
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check for error messages in the console

### Images not loading
- Ensure image files are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- Check that file paths are accessible
- Verify images aren't corrupted

### Poor performance with many artworks
- Try reducing the number of artworks in a single workspace
- Lower the zoom level
- Close and reopen the application to clear cache

### Export fails
- Ensure you have write permissions to the export location
- Check available disk space
- Try exporting at a lower resolution

## Current Limitations

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version with the following limitations:

- **Photo mode**: Wall photo import with perspective correction is not yet implemented
- **Advanced editing**: White balance adjustments and perspective correction for artwork are not yet available
- **Rotation**: Artwork rotation in workspace is not yet implemented
- **Advanced features**: Guidelines, alignment tools, and multi-select are planned for future releases

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for upcoming releases:

- Wall photo import with 4-point perspective correction
- Advanced artwork editing (white balance, rotation, cropping)
- Workspace guidelines and snapping
- Alignment and distribution tools
- Frame templates and bulk framing
- Multiple workspace variations
- Enhanced export options (custom DPI, measurement overlays)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (to be implemented)
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Building for Distribution

```bash
# Using PyInstaller (Windows example)
pyinstaller --name="GalleryWallApp" \
            --windowed \
            --onedir \
            --add-data "assets;assets" \
            main.py
```
